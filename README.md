# Jarvis
A virtual DJ of sorts using speech recognition to play a song from youtube.

Uses the Speech Recognition, VLC Python Bindings, and pafy 3rd party libraries as well as the VLC media player itself, and various standard python libraries.

Background listening is planned, but much later down the road. (So the user can activate the program by saying "Jarvis" much like the Echo product from amazon or apple's Siri.)

This project is mainly for fun during the summer, but also to learn a bit about python.
